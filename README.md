# Polynomial-Regression-in-One-Dimension

In this question, we will repeat the experiments discussed in the class with respect to polynomial regression but with a different function. [30 Marks]
1. Generate 20 data points from function f(x) = cos(2πx) + x/2π + noise where noise∼ N (0, 0.004) with x ranging from 0 to 2π.
2. Fit a polynomial regression with optimal weight vector w∗ and plot the curves for different degree of polynomials M = 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10. Explain your observations by plotting the data points generated and the curve obtained for different values of M.
3. Repeat the previous experiments with more number of data points and report your findings.
